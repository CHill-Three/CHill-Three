## Introduction
Hello! My name is Charles and I am an undergraduate student attending the University of Texas at Dallas, currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. Currently, I am seeking an internship or full-time opportunities.

- 🔭 I’m currently learning to utilize **RSLogix 5000**.
- ⚡ I’m currently improving my **Verilog coding skills**.
- 🏀 Fun fact 🏈: I love basketball and gridiron football.

## My Main Projects (In Progress/Past)
| Program List | Description |
| :-: | --- |
| [Vivado (FPGA Development)](https://github.com/CHill-Three/vivado.projects) | Vivado is a Verilog-based programming platform resource designed for users to create and/or modify field-programmable gate array (FPGA) system designs. This is a list of my completed projects utilizing Vivado Design Suite. The Vivado Design Suite starter projects featured on this website are my attempts at completing starter projects with the Artix-7 FPGA Family (Package: cpg236)(Part ID: xc7a35tcpg236-1). |
| [Tinkercad](https://github.com/CHill-Three/tinkercad.projects) | Tinkercad is a free and online educational resource for computer-aided design (CAD) purposes, where users can create and/or modify electronic designs. This is a list of my completed projects using Tinkercad. |
| [MATLAB](https://github.com/CHill-Three/matlab.projects) | MATLAB is a programming platform resource designed for users to create and/or modify electronic system designs. This is a list of my completed starter projects utilizing MATLAB. |
| [MARS 4.5 (MIPS Programming)](https://github.com/CHill-Three/mars.projects) | MARS 4.5 is a free educational resource focusing on microprocessor without interlocked pipelined stages (MIPS) programming, where users can create and/or modify their assembly language code. This is a list of my completed starter projects utilizing MARS 4.5. |
| [Arduino](https://github.com/CHill-Three/arduino.projects) | Arduino is an educational C-programming platform resource designed for users to create and/or modify electronic system designs. This is a list of my completed projects from the starter projects derived from ELEGOO’s Arduino manual. |
